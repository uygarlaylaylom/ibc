;;ClearView Glass Railings;Outdoor Living, Leisure, & Modular Structures;Lakeland;Minnesota;S2184;https://www.buildersshow.com/exhibitor/clearviewglassrailings;ClearView Glass Railings is a glass railing supplier located in Minnesota. Unlike hardwoods, glass railings don’t need repeated painting or finishing for enhancing their durability. This is a vital consideration since decks/patios are continuously exposed to external, weather conditions. CVGRailings Hercules Glass panels use tempered laminated panels with patent pending Lever Spigots made of Duplex 2205 Stainless Steel. Neither glass nor the patent pending Lever Spigots made of Duplex 2205 Stainless Steel corrode when exposed to water. The outer surface of glass panels is better suited to tolerate temperature extremes. As a result, unlike hardwood railings, glass railings are not vulnerable to surface cracking. CVGRailings Hercules Glass panels are test proven to hold an amazing 2,520# vertical load and a 820# horizontal load. They are 13.5mm thick tempered laminated glass made with two layers of 6mm tempered glass that is laminated together with a 1.5mm layer of a PVB plastic glass panel. This makes glass railings as sturdy and safe as wood or purely metal based railings. The use of transparent glass ensures that visibility through the deck is maintained. Blocking of the external view is a major issue with metal/wood railings.;Product;No Website Found;;;;offline_dossier/detailed_reports/clearview-glass-railings/report.md;Hercules Glass panels, Lever Spigots;;clearviewglassrailings.com

;;Greenstone Slate Company;Building Materials;Poultney;Vermont;W6992;https://www.buildersshow.com/exhibitor/greenstoneslatecompany;Genuine slate roofs remain the choice for elegance, longevity and durability—outperforming synthetics in every way. Greenstone Slate’s quarries have produced exceptionally fine quality stone for roofing slate for over a century. Greenstone has shipped slate all over the world for residential and institutional projects. Our quarries are located in the heart of what is known as the Slate Valley— a region primarily in Vermont, extending slightly into New York State. It is a region that has a history of producing some of the finest quality slate in the world. All Greenstone architectural roofing slate meets ASTM C406, and is rated S1, the highest available strength and longevity rating. Our stone is worked by Greenstone-trained craftsmen and our production facilities are continually updated and expanded to enhance our standards of excellence in manufacturing. This has led the Greenstone Slate Company to become a principal worldwide producer of colored slate roofing. A Greenstone Slate® roof can be expected to have a useful life range of 75 to more than 300 years. Beyond the prestigious ASTM S1, 75-year life expectancy rating, our slate is backed by Greenstone’s 100-year warranty. We consistently deliver high-quality product, excellence in service and installation support, and competitive direct pricing—for the highest value possible in a slate roof. This year at The International Builders’ Show, we’ll be highlighting the benefits of the Greenstone Slate’s HAILFIRE™ ultimate roof! We’ll also be demonstrating the breakthrough slate lightweight installation method—SlateTec™—that reduces the weight of a genuine slate roof installation without compromise in protection or appearance. Genuine slate roofs can now be installed on nearly any new or re-roof project, even historical roof restorations that may have structural obstacles due to age, when a slate roof aesthetic and protection are desirable to maintain. A roof cross-section will be on display showing how SlateTec installation technology can reduce roof weight to under 6 pounds per square foot, can lower structural costs, and streamline the installation of the slate itself. We invite architects, contractors, project managers, and building envelope specialists to visit our booth or contact us to discuss the long-term protection and environmental benefits of Greenstone® Vermont slate for any roofing or cladding project.;Product;No Website Found;;;;offline_dossier/detailed_reports/greenstone-slate-company/report.md;Genuine slate roofs, Greenstone Slate HAILFIRE™ ultimate roof, SlateTec™ lightweight installation method;Shipping slate worldwide, Slate roof installation support, Demonstrations at trade shows;greenstoneslate.com

Their lineup includes: Power Pet Door: Fully automatic and motor-driven, this door opens only when triggered by a pet wearing a tiny ultrasonic collar. It uses directional sensing so it activates only when the pet is directly approaching, minimizing false triggers. The translucent, high-strength poly carbonate panel slides up and down on a tight seal and locks with a deadbolt, ensuring strong insulation and security WiFi-Enabled Power Pet Doors (e.g., Power Pet WiFi Door): These retain all the core features of the Power Pet series while adding remote control through a smartphone app. Users can open/close the door, configure up to 20 weekly access timers, adjust sensor ranges, and view a log of door activity. Motorized Power Pet Roll-Up Doors: These doors — available in medium, large, and extra-large sizes — feature a motorized roll-up panel (rather than a rigid flap) that retracts upward. Activation is via the same ultrasonic collar, and the door is controllable via the Power Pet app. It provides strong insulation, security, low draft, and 4-way access control. Armor Flex Manual Doors (e.g., Armor Flex Pet Door): These are engineered to be extremely durable and weather-tight. Their flap is made from interlocking ABS segments, each sealed by rare-earth magnets to ensure a rigid, airtight closure along the sides yet flexible enough for your pet to pass through. The frame is heavy-gauge aluminum with stainless steel hardware. DuraFlex (DuraFlex) Pet Door: Designed for lifetime durability, these doors feature a strong yet flexible vinyl flap surrounded by a wide flange with embedded rare-earth magnets. The frame is made of high-strength aluminum, sealed with floating magnetic seals for a 100% airtight, draft-free fit—even in winds up to 50 mph Why choose High Tech Pet?

;;InSoFast, LLC;Building Materials;Mitchell;South Dakota;W7973;https://www.buildersshow.com/exhibitor/insofastllc;A Leader in Innovative Continuous Insulation and Framing Systems For over 20 years, we have been an innovator in the insulation industry, with engineered solutions that save time and money. We pride ourselves on excellent customer service and quality products 100% made in the USA. InSoFast strives to change the way homes are built, making them more comfortable, energy efficient and healthier. We are passionate about “The Perfect Wall” and bringing this vision for high performance homes to the building science industry with our insulation solutions. Who We Are At our core, InSoFast is focused on performance-driven innovation. We design insulation systems to solve real-world challenges including thermal bridging, condensation, mold risk, and labor inefficiency. Every product is engineered to work as part of a complete system—reducing complexity on the jobsite while improving building outcomes for contractors, designers, and owners alike. All InSoFast products are manufactured in the USA, and we ship to all lower 48 U.S. states and Canada, delivering directly to the project site to simplify logistics and scheduling. Our team prides themselves on supporting projects with excellent customer service, personalized recommendations and access to technical experts throughout the project. InSoFast Insulation Panels InSoFast insulation panels are the foundation of our system approach. Designed for interior, exterior, and shipping container applications, these panels combine continuous insulation with built-in attachment points for finishes, eliminating the need for traditional framing in many assemblies. Interior Panels help transform basements, retrofit spaces, and new construction by improving thermal performance while creating a ready-to-finish surface. Exterior Panels deliver continuous insulation to reduce thermal bridging and supports durable, high-performance building envelopes. Shipping Container Panels address one of the most challenging building types by controlling condensation, improving comfort, and streamlining interior projects. Together, these panels help projects move faster while supporting energy-efficient, code-compliant construction. The X-Bracket System The X‑Bracket System is a structural framing innovation designed for both residential construction and shipping container projects. This advanced polymer bracket system replaces much of the traditional lumber framing required in walls, creating strong, straight, and thermally efficient assemblies. By reducing wood usage and eliminating thermal bridging, the X-Bracket System supports healthier indoor environments while enabling builders to frame faster with greater consistency. It integrates seamlessly with InSoFast insulation panels, creating a unified system that enhances performance without adding complexity. Introducing the Batt-Bracket (Coming 2026) Launching in January 2026, the Batt‑Bracket expands InSoFast solutions to support traditional batt insulation within a smarter framing framework. The Batt-Bracket provides flexibility for projects which require or prefer batt insulation—without sacrificing alignment, performance, or efficiency. Built for Builders. Designed for Performance. From manufacturing in the United States to delivering directly to job sites across the lower 48 states and Canada, InSoFast is committed to helping builders succeed. Our systems are trusted on projects ranging from homes and multifamily buildings to commercial spaces and innovative shipping container developments. Step into the future of insulation with InSoFast, we’d love to partner on your next project!;Product;No Website Found;;;;offline_dossier/detailed_reports/insofast-llc/report.md;InSoFast Insulation Panels, X-Bracket System, Batt-Bracket;excellent customer service, personalized recommendations, access to technical experts, direct delivery to project sites;insofast.com

We are shaking up the floor vent industry by giving you new and improved options in heating, air conditioning, and air exchange floor vents. Ventique Metal Vents are here to offer a solution for flooring installers and homeowners alike-vents that are as unique as your floors. Over the years, we found that ordinary raised drop-in floor vents do not add anything to a home’s look, feel or value. So, we set out to create a custom product that is functional and stylish, but also easy to install for skilled craftsman and DIY homeowners. Ventique metal vents are compatible with nearly any type of flooring, and their flush mount for a seamless finish. Our unique design with its flush mount frame and grill inserts set them apart from other vents. Our frame design is a ½” thick allowing for most tile flooring to be set flush with the frame. Composed of powder coated aluminum our vents will not rust chip, bend, crack, or peel. And in durability tests our metal vents have proven their weight by upholding more than 875 pounds. We know that you may never have thought about your floor vents before as being something that you could pick a different style. Now you can. Why wait, upgrade yourself from the standard old boring vents you settled for to something new, beautiful, and smooth on the surface, Ventiques vents. All our vents are flush mount making them handicap accessible. For those in wheelchairs, scooters, or even using walkers, even the smallest bump of a raised floor vent can be a huge obstacle-and a safety risk. Our newest product our Kanyon Vents. Are fully adjustable. Meaning you can adjust the height of the register to the thickness of your flooring. Making it flush mount for any type of flooring. Go from 1/8"" on up. Simply add spacers to adjust the height of the vent.

Designed specifically for modern residential and light commercial construction, Washbox products allow painters, builders, and contractors to clean tools efficiently on site while capturing and containing wash water, waste solids, and microplastic emissions. By keeping liquid waste on site and out of drainage systems, Washbox helps projects maintain clean working environments, protect surrounding communities, and uphold premium build standards.

It enables multiple trades to wash tools on site without plumbing connections, discharge points, or permanent infrastructure. Its compact, freestanding design makes it ideal for custom home builds, fit outs, and active renovation projects. The Washbox Rover extends this capability into ultra-portable applications, allowing professional washout to take place directly from a vehicle, driveway, or confined residential site. Built for contractors on the move, Rover delivers full containment and waste capture in a compact format suited to single family homes and small-scale projects. Complementing these systems, and also available as a standalone device to be used with nay garden hose, the Rollerwash collar provides painters with a simple, controlled method for washing and reusing rollers. By containing wash water and preventing splashing or runoff, it helps improve site cleanliness, extend tool life, and reduce unnecessary waste. All Washbox systems are designed around three core principles: efficiency, professionalism, and environmental responsibility. Every product is engineered to save time, reduce mess, and simplify compliance, while supporting higher standards of workmanship and site management. Washbox is also the world’s first app connected wash station platform, giving users access to a secure cloud dashboard where they can view water use, waste captured, and pollution prevented across individual projects or portfolios.
