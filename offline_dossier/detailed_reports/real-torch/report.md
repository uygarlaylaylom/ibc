## IBS Description
Real Torch is a market intelligence company for homebuilders. Our AI research agent, Atlas, delivers market intelligence in minutes, not months. 
We answer the questions that keep you up at 3am: How much should I pay for this lot? How fast will these homes sell? What are my competitors doing? What square footage actually moves in this market? 
What Atlas delivers: Demographics and buyer pool analysis. Competitive pricing intelligence. Absorption forecasts that tell you how long your specs will sit. School district data (because buyers always ask). CMA generation for bank loans. Off-market transaction data you can't get from MLS. 
What you avoid: $15K feasibility studies that take months. The 25 browser tabs of DIY research. Mispricing a home and watching it sit. Overpaying for land because you didn't know what sold down the street. 
We built Atlas because builders shouldn't need a six-figure research budget to make confident development decisions. Tell us a ZIP code. We'll show you what we see.
