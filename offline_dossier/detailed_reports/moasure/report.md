## IBS Description
Moasure, founded in 2014, are revolutionizing how professionals measure and document spaces with their unique, patented motion sensor-based technology. 
The Moasure 2 series utilizes high-performance motion sensors to capture x, y, and z data as it moves, simultaneously measuring and drawing complex and irregular outdoor projects.  
Automatically calculating perimeter, area, elevation, gradient and volume, Moasure collects essential measurement data without the need for GPS, Wi-Fi or mobile phone signal. 
The Bluetooth-connected app transforms measurements into dynamic 2D and 3D visuals in real-time on your smartphone screen – view, edit and save measurements, export as PDF/CSV or directly to CAD software. 
With over 100,000 Moasure 2 series devices sold to outdoor professionals, Moasure are now applying their award-winning technology to an indoor measuring device, designed to create instant floor plans with ease. 
Moasure LX1, launching later this year, will enable the user to simply walk through a property and capture accurate measurements within minutes, whilst watching the floor plan come to life on their tablet or smartphone in real time. The device captures area, perimeter, windows, doors, ceiling heights and wall thickness, and can handle irregular rooms with complex angles, including curved walls. 
A fully dimensioned floor plan is available in the Moasure app the moment the user finishes measuring, and can be exported directly to CAD software or shared as a PDF. 
LX1 offers a faster and smarter way to create accurate floor plans, fitting seamlessly into existing workflows.
