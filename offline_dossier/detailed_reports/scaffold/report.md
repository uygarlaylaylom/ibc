## IBS Description
Scaffold is a data integration and automation platform purpose-built for specialty trade contractors and suppliers in residential construction. 
We connect directly to homebuilder systems and portals to automate the flow of critical project data. Scaffold reads purchase orders, floorplans, selection sheets, and other builder documents, then uses AI to map that data directly into the core tools trades already use to run their businesses. 
The result is the elimination of manual data entry, fewer errors, faster response times, and materially lower operational overhead for teams managing high volumes of homes across multiple builders.
