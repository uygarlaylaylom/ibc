## IBS Description
A new direction in moisture control. 
Adept Materials develops smart building products powered by our patented Vaporwisp™ technology, first created in our founder’s physics laboratory at Brown University. Our materials are engineered to respond to their environment, redefining how vapor, humidity, and temperature are managed throughout the building envelope. 
Lilypad Paint is the first product launched with this technology. We are now expanding Vaporwisp™ into weather-resistant wraps, integrated sheathing, and roofing underlayments to deliver a new generation of adaptive, high-performance materials. 
The future of materials is connected by design. We are building it.
