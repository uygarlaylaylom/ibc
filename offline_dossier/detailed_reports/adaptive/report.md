## IBS Description
Adaptive is the AI-Native project accounting platform for construction.
Adaptive replaces reactive accounting with continuous financial control across job costing, WIP, billings, and cash — with a fraction of the effort. 
Most construction teams lose weeks every month chasing the field for receipts and job cost input, reconciling disconnected systems, and sitting through status meetings just to understand where budgets stand. Adaptive changes that. 
With Adaptive, AI does the accounting work for you: 


Auto-job cost every transaction and route it for approval 


Track retainage and AIA billing with clean, consistent workflows 


Flag financial risks early (missing change orders, over/under billings, WIP issues) 


Follow up on vendors in bulk (missing billings, backup, compliance) 


Train AI to match how your business operates with “memories” and rules 


Whether you’re cost-plus or fixed-price, Adaptive helps you: 


Never hire another project accountant 


Level up your current team 


Always know where you stand on WIP + cash 

Get an AI agent across all project financials

Trusted by nearly 1,000 construction companies from $5M–$500M in revenue, Adaptive integrates with your existing stack and gets teams live fast, delivering quick wins now with enterprise-grade flexibility as you scale. 
Stop chasing the field. Start running projects with real-time financial control.
