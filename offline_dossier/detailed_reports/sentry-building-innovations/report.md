Our Mission
To provide high-performance building materials that meet the evolving demands of modern construction, combining advanced technology with practical reliability to safeguard homes and buildings from the elements. 
What We Do
Sentry Building Innovations specializes in the development and distribution of cutting-edge waterproofing products, including synthetic roofing underlayments, weather-resistant barriers, and other protective materials for the building envelope. Our growing family of brands includes: 
- Roofnado™ – Take control with Roofnado™Roofnado™ is a trusted line of synthetic roofing underlayments engineered to serve as the critical water-control layer in modern roof systems. Designed to manage water before it becomes a problem, Roofnado products protect the roof deck from wind-driven rain, temporary exposure 
, and jobsite delays—putting control back in the hands of the installer. 
Built for durability, confident walkability, and long-term weather resistance, products like StormTread™, AnchorDeck™, and Spyder PSU™ deliver dependable performance across a wide range of roofing applications. From new construction to re-roofing, Roofnado underlayments help ensure the roof system performs as intended—day one through the life of the roof. 
  
- Spyder PSU™ – The ultimate sand replacement ice & water shield, engineered for modern roofing systems. This peel-and-stick synthetic underlayment delivers aggressive adhesion, reliable UV resistance, and confident walkability—without the mess, weight, or inconsistency of traditional sand-surfaced membranes. 
Its innovative design features a 3-inch overlap zone that securely bonds to the sheet below, speeding installation while creating a continuous, watertight seal on sloped roofs. Spyder PSU™ puts installers in control with cleaner handling, faster installs, and dependable water protection where it matters most. 
  
Sahara™ WRBs – High-performance weather-resistant barriers engineered with DRYZA™ Smart Nano Technology to deliver controlled breathability and dependable protection against air and moisture infiltration. Designed to block bulk water while allowing water vapor to escape, Sahara WRBs support drying potential within the wall assembly—helping protect the building envelope from moisture-related risk. 
Built for durability, consistent performance, and compatibility with modern tapes and flashings, Sahara™ WRBs provide a critical balance of water resistance and vapor permeability for residential and light commercial construction.
