## IBS Description
Mono Slab® EZ Form is a patented product that allows you to form, insulate and back-fill all before you pour and place concrete. Mono Slab® EZ form removes several steps compared to the traditional forming and insulating process. The traditional forming process required several steps, including pounding up to 150 metal stakes, 80 – 100 Wood Brace boards, and extensive amounts of lumber to create the forms, not to mention the tedious process of removing all the stakes and brace boards once the project had been poured.
