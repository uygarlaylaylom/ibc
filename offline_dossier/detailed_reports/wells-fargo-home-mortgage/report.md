1 The Builder Spec Lock fee allows you to lock in a range of interest rates on one lock per property for 90 or 120 days. 
The locked interest rate range may be used on any property you own. It cannot be transferred to a property owned by another party. You must provide Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Lender”) a binding real estate sales contract for a property at least 30 days prior to lock expiration. If the lock is not transferred to a homebuyer by the expiration date, it will be cancelled. Lender cannot guarantee a loan will close before the lock expires. If the buyer requires additional time to close, the buyer may request a rate lock extension, which will be subject to our rate lock extension policy. 
Available only on agency, non-agency, FHA, and VA loans. 
Equal Housing Lender.
