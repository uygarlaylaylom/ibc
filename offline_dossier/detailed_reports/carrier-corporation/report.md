## IBS Description
We invented HVAC. Yes, really. Our founder, Willis Carrier, invented modern air conditioning in 1902. And since then, we’ve continued to build on that legacy. We understand that homes have multiple purposes - kitchen tables are also home offices, spare bedrooms turn into gyms, and living rooms become entertainment centers. That’s why at Carrier, we develop smart features designed for the ways you actually live, work and play. Because no matter how you use it, your house will always be your home—and we’ll always be imagining new ways to make it more comfortable.
