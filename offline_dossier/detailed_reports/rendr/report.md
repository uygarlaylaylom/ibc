## IBS Description
RENDR is an AI-powered scanning and design platform built by contractors, for contractors. Using just an iPhone or iPad, RENDR instantly turns real-world spaces into detailed floor plans, room takeoffs, and 3D models — eliminating the time and errors of manual measuring and drafting. Its groundbreaking Invite-to-Capture feature lets homeowners or field reps scan spaces remotely, so contractors can quote and design jobs before ever setting foot on site. 
By integrating with leading tools like Chief Architect and JobTread, RENDR streamlines the entire sales lifecycle — from first scan to final estimate. The result? Faster sales, better accuracy, and more time back for what matters most.
