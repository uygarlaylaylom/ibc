## IBS Description
Warming Trends® creates premium outdoor fire features where craftsmanship, durability, and architectural beauty come together. 
Our signature CROSSFIRE® Brass Burners produce a taller, brighter, fuller flame with natural movement and presence... designed to become the focal point of outdoor spaces. Every burner is constructed entirely of solid brass, a material chosen for its corrosion resistance, longevity, and ability to perform beautifully in any environment. This uncompromising construction allows us to confidently offer a lifetime warranty, one of the strongest in the industry. 
Complementing our burners, we offer a complete ecosystem of fire solutions, including modern ignition systems and Architectural Concrete Vessels designed to anchor a space with sculptural form and refined texture. Together, our products empower architects, builders, and designers to bring outdoor visions to life. Transforming patios, poolscapes, and gathering spaces into places people naturally gravitate toward. 
Proudly designed, manufactured, and assembled in the United States, Warming Trends® supports local Colorado commerce and trusted parts manufacturers nationwide. Every product reflects our commitment to quality, performance, and timeless outdoor living.
