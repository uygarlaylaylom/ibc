## IBS Description
Ouros Materials is an early-stage building materials startup developing MESOSTONE, an inherently fire-resistant and low-cost composite panel platform. MESOSTONE panels are engineered to deliver fire performance through the full panel thickness, rather than through surface-applied coatings or treatments, enabling simpler installation and integration into code-driven building assemblies. Additionally, MESOSTONE delivers exceptional sustainability advantages by sequestering CO2 and using a novel low-temperature ceramic manufacturing method. Ouros is currently piloting composite panels and partnering with manufacturers, builders, and contractors on testing and early applications.
