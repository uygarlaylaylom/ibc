## IBS Description
Take Back Control of Your Blades. 
Tired of wasting money on saw blades that go dull after just a few cuts? We were too. That’s why we created Tiger’s Teeth—a line of rugged, patent-pending sharpening and cutting tools built by real tradespeople for real-world jobs. 
At the heart of our lineup is the Tiger’s Teeth Multi-Sharpener—the first truly portable, do-it-anywhere sharpener for all your blades: oscillating, circular, reciprocating, hole saws, even drill bits. Whether your blade is steel, bi-metal, or carbide, this tool gets it sharp—fast. It runs off any major-brand cordless tool battery or a standard wall plug, so you’re never stuck waiting or making a run to the store mid-project. 
But we didn’t stop there. 
Introducing MEGA-Life Oscillating Blades—quite possibly the longest-lasting multi-tool blades on the market. Each one features an extra-deep strip of bi-metal or carbide welded or brazed to the body, giving you unmatched cutting life and resharpening potential. Paired with our Multi-Sharpener, these blades can be resharpened dozens of times, outlasting anything else in your toolbox. 
This isn’t just a small step forward in blade tech—it’s a leap.
