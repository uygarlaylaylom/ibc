## IBS Description
We craft the highest-grade Yakisugi siding in the world — And we’ve been doing it diligently for 50 years. 
The Nakamoto Zourin group is owned and managed by the Nakamoto family and headquartered in western Japan. We have managed sugi and hinoki forest in Hiroshima since the 1920’s and have four main mills in Hiroshima and Tokushima prefectures that mill siding and flooring from sugi, hinoki, pine, oak, cherry, cedar, spruce, larch, and other species. Nakamoto Zourin is the largest siding mill in Japan and the largest manufacturer of yakisugi in the world. We are affiliated with WoodOne, the largest flooring manufacturer in Japan and the largest radiata pine timberland owner in New Zealand. Additionally, in cooperation with Sumitomo Forestry we supply our off-grade logs to the biomass fuel market in Japan. 
Nakamoto Forestry North America distributes jobsite-direct throughout North America from a stocking warehouse and prefinished shop in Portland, Oregon. Nakamoto Forestry Europe distributes throughout the European region from a stocking warehouse in Duesseldorf, Germany. 
Nakamoto Zourin is PEFC certified, a chain of custody sustainable forestry compliance standard. Worldwide we mill and ship 650,000-810,000 square feet (60,000-75,000m2) of yakisugi every month, and have a surge capacity double these numbers. We can handle any size project you would like to specify our products for.
