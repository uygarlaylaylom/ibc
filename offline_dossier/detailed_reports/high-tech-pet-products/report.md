## IBS Description
High Tech Pet Products offers a comprehensive suite of cutting-edge pet doors, combining security, weather resistance, and smart technology. Their lineup includes: 


Power Pet Door: Fully automatic and motor-driven, this door opens only when triggered by a pet wearing a tiny ultrasonic collar. It uses directional sensing so it activates only when the pet is directly approaching, minimizing false triggers. The translucent, high-strength poly carbonate panel slides up and down on a tight seal and locks with a deadbolt, ensuring strong insulation and security 


WiFi-Enabled Power Pet Doors (e.g., Power Pet WiFi Door): These retain all the core features of the Power Pet series while adding remote control through a smartphone app. Users can open/close the door, configure up to 20 weekly access timers, adjust sensor ranges, and view a log of door activity. 


Motorized Power Pet Roll-Up Doors: These doors — available in medium, large, and extra-large sizes — feature a motorized roll-up panel (rather than a rigid flap) that retracts upward. Activation is via the same ultrasonic collar, and the door is controllable via the Power Pet app. It provides strong insulation, security, low draft, and 4-way access control. 


Armor Flex Manual Doors (e.g., Armor Flex Pet Door): These are engineered to be extremely durable and weather-tight. Their flap is made from interlocking ABS segments, each sealed by rare-earth magnets to ensure a rigid, airtight closure along the sides yet flexible enough for your pet to pass through. The frame is heavy-gauge aluminum with stainless steel hardware. 


DuraFlex (DuraFlex) Pet Door: Designed for lifetime durability, these doors feature a strong yet flexible vinyl flap surrounded by a wide flange with embedded rare-earth magnets. The frame is made of high-strength aluminum, sealed with floating magnetic seals for a 100% airtight, draft-free fit—even in winds up to 50 mph 



Why choose High Tech Pet? Their pet doors combine smart automation, durable construction, and exceptional sealing, backed by decades of innovation. Whether you want a fully automatic, app-controlled door like their Power Pet or a rugged, energy-efficient manual flap like Armor Flex or DuraFlex, High Tech Pet delivers premium access solutions that enhance both pet freedom and home security.
