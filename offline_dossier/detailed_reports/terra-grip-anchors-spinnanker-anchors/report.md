## IBS Description
Terra Grip Anchors - the smarter, faster, stronger way to build.
Whether you are constructing a deck, shed, fence or other structure, our patented system offers concrete-free footings you can trust.  Terra Grip Anchors are ideal for professional contractors. These anchors are easy to install, without the mess, weight or complexity of traditional footings with concrete. Achieve professional-grade results with less time and effort.  No special equipment is needed - Terra Grips are designed for a 1 person install with a standard impact driver. 
Spinnanker Foundation System
Spinnanker™ is a revolutionary ground anchor system designed for maximum holding power, trouble-free installation, and low environmental impact. Ideal for commercial, industrial, and residential applications – especially in environmentally sensitive or difficult-to-access locations, the Spinnanker system replaces traditional concrete footings with a high-performance, mess-free foundation or anchoring solution. 
Based on the root system of a tree, the Spinnanker system is engineered to deliver superior holding strength in almost any soil type. Threaded rods are driven through the Spinnanker anchor plate into the soil to absorb the required load. The number and length of rods is adaptable to the specific needs of the foundation.
