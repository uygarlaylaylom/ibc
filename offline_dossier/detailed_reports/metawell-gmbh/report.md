## IBS Description
As an innovative developer and manufacturer of aluminum lightweight panels, we produce very lightweight yet extremely rigid lightweight panels in Bavaria for over 40 years. Our products are used in transportation, in construction and for industrial applications.  
Metawall facade products are extremely lightweight yet rigid aluminum lightweight panels – ideal for cladding. Thanks to the clever structure with an aluminum corrugated core, even large-area elements are flat, dimensionally stable and allow large spans. This reduces the need for a substructure and makes installation faster and more economical. Metawall consists entirely of aluminium (approx. 80% secondary aluminium), is corrosion-resistant and 100% recyclable without material separation. For cladding we offer the products Metawall B1 and Metawall A2.
