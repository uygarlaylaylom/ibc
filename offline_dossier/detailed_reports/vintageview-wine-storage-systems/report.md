## IBS Description
A Quarter Century of Perfecting the Wine as Design 
A great custom home isn't built on specs. It's built on experiences. For 25 years, VintageView has provided the backdrop for the world’s best moments, transforming wine storage from a utility into a centerpiece. 
We are the original. The inventors of the label-forward aesthetic. But at the International Builders Show 2026, we aren't looking back. We are reshaping the horizon. 
Join us to experience the Vino Series Window, a design-forward shelving revelation that opens up new visual possibilities for your interiors. Pair a wine racking installation with the new Goguette Multi-Zone Wine Fridge, and you have a complete ecosystem of preservation and presentation. 
Whether it’s our iconic W Series Wine Rack or these groundbreaking new releases, everything we make is backed by a lifetime warranty and supported by our complimentary design services. There is a reason we have been the preferred wine rack of every New American Home project since 2020. 
Your clients collect wine. You collect accolades. Let’s build something extraordinary together.
