## IBS Description
SAMI AI — The 24/7 Lead Engagement Engine Built for Home Builders
SAMI AI helps home builders capture, qualify, and convert more online leads without adding headcount. The platform instantly calls, texts, and follows up with every new inquiry from your website, ads, and listing portals: engaging prospects within seconds, not hours. 
SAMI holds natural, human-like conversations to identify timeline, budget, location, and intent, then routes qualified prospects directly to your sales counselors or OSC team. No missed leads. No delayed follow-up. No wasted ad spend. 
Built specifically for higher-volume builder environments, SAMI supports: 


High lead volume across communities and markets 


Consistent follow-up 24/7, including nights and weekends 


Automated qualification before human handoff 


CRM-agnostic integrations 


Call, SMS, and conversation tracking for accountability 


Builders use SAMI to increase appointment rates, improve response time, and reduce cost per conversion, while freeing their sales teams to focus on buyers who are actually ready to move forward.
