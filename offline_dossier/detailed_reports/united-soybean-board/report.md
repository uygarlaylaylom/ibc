## IBS Description
How do you make building materials and products high performing and more sustainable? Use soybean-based chemistry from U.S. Soy. 
Visit the United Soybean Board (USB) exhibit to learn about the performance and sustainability advantages of hundreds of products for green building applications that are made with U.S. Soy. 
The USB booth will feature a display of products made with soybean-based chemistry, including adhesives for wood flooring and cabinetry; paints and stains; coatings and sealers for wood and concrete; thermoset applications ranging from polyurethane spray foam insulation to vanity tops; and a variety of cleaners and solvents. Major brands marketing soy-based building products include: Sherwin Williams, Rust-Oleum, Columbia Forest Products, HempWood, W.F. Taylor Co., Solenis and Huntsman. 
In addition to improved performance, soy-based products deliver a range of health and environmental benefits based on the application, such as being biodegradable, lower VOCs, improved indoor air quality, reduced carbon footprint, etc. U.S. Soy is natural, renewable and sustainable alternative to petroleum-based chemicals and is being used by companies like Goodyear, Ford, Rust-Oleum, Solenis, Cargill and many others to meet a growing consumer expectation for performance plus sustainability. 
USB is an innovation leader partnering with industry to deliver sustainable solutions to every life, every day from U.S. Soy. USB funds and supports research with industry to commercialize sustainable building and construction products and other industrial applications that are developed using the unique properties of soy-based chemical derivatives for performance advantages. The farmer-led organization represents more than 500,000 soybean farmers in 31 states. For more information, visit www.soynewuses.org.
