## IBS Description
Trusscore products are transforming residential construction. They’re designed as the ideal alternative and improvement for conventional residential wall systems like painted drywall. Strong, light in weight, and easy to install, Trusscore products deliver improved functionality for a home, particularly for a home’s utility areas – think garages, workshops, laundry rooms, basements, and mudrooms.  
Made from PVC, Trusscore Wall&CeilingBoard and Trusscore SlatWall will transform any space. The durable, lightweight, and easy to install wall and ceiling panels combined with the high functioning organization possibilities of Trusscore SlatWall make them the perfect pair. Together, they create a fabulous bright, clean finish that’s long-lasting, waterproof, and abuse resistant – perfect for high-traffic areas.  
Trusscore is loved and installed by Build Show Live influencers and custom builders Matt Risinger and Lydia Crawford (aka Drywall Shorty).
