## IBS Description
V-ROD® Rebar is a high-performance, non-corrosive reinforcement made from glass fiber–reinforced polymer (GFRP). Engineered as a modern alternative to traditional steel rebar, V-ROD delivers exceptional strength, durability, and longevity in concrete structures—especially in harsh or corrosive environments. 
Unlike steel, V-ROD will not rust, corrode, or degrade when exposed to moisture, salt, chemicals, or extreme temperatures. Its lightweight design makes handling and installation easier and safer, while its high tensile strength and thermal compatibility with concrete help extend the service life of structures. 
V-ROD rebar is commonly used in bridges, marine structures, parking garages, highways, industrial facilities, residential housing and other applications where long-term durability and reduced maintenance are critical. By eliminating corrosion-related damage, V-ROD helps lower lifecycle costs and supports more resilient, sustainable construction.
