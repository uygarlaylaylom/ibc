## IBS Description
Chief Architect is powerful and easy-to-use home design software for builders, designers, architects, remodelers, and kitchen, bath & interior designers. The tools in Chief Architect automate the design process, giving you more time to focus on design concepts and converting leads into sales. Photo-realistic renderings, virtual tours, and virtual reality features are a by-product of the design process, so very little effort is required to provide the client with renderings that help them visualize your design ideas. Quickly create a full set of construction documents, including structural details, cross-sections, schedules, and more. The materials list feature provides instant access to material quantities for providing cost estimates.
