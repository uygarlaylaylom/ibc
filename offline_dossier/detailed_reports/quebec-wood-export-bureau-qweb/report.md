## IBS Description
The Quebec Wood Export Bureau (QWEB) is a non-profit organization created in 1996 whose mission is to develop export markets for wood products from Quebec, to ensure access of these products on the markets and to promote the use of wood in all markets, as regional, provincial and international. QWEB has about 125 export companies in five different groups: softwood lumber and value-added softwood; hardwood lumber and added value hardwood; wood flooring; wood construction; and wood pellets. 
To achieve its objectives regarding market development and market access, besides the managers who work for each group, QWEB also has specialists in three overseas offices: United Kingdom (Salisbury), Japan (Tokyo) and the United States (Vermont). 
Finally, for several years, QWEB is actively involved in several major international negotiating tables where wood material is considered as a concrete way to tackle climate change. This is the case of the Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiative of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
