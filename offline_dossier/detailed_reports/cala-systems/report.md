## IBS Description
Cala is the world’s first intelligent heat pump water heater designed to deliver reliable hot water while dramatically reducing energy use and operating costs. 
Unlike traditional water heaters that react after hot water runs out, Cala uses predictive intelligence to learn a home’s daily hot water patterns and heat water ahead of demand. The result: more usable hot water, lower electricity bills, and quieter operation—without homeowners needing to manage modes or settings. 
Cala integrates seamlessly with modern homes, including solar, batteries, and variable electricity pricing, and installs like other heat pump water heaters. For builders, that means a future-ready solution that meets electrification goals, qualifies for incentives, and delivers a better homeowner experience from day one. 
Built in the U.S. and backed by a 10-year parts and 3 year labor warranty, Cala Systems helps builders deliver homes that are comfortable, resilient, and ready for what’s next without asking homeowners to think twice about their hot water.
