## IBS Description
A Leader in Innovative Continuous Insulation and Framing Systems 
For over 20 years, we have been an innovator in the insulation industry, with engineered solutions that save time and money. We pride ourselves on excellent customer service and quality products 100% made in the USA. InSoFast strives to change the way homes are built, making them more comfortable, energy efficient and healthier. We are passionate about “The Perfect Wall” and bringing this vision for high performance homes to the building science industry with our insulation solutions. 
Who We Are 
At our core, InSoFast is focused on performance-driven innovation. We design insulation systems to solve real-world challenges including thermal bridging, condensation, mold risk, and labor inefficiency. Every product is engineered to work as part of a complete system—reducing complexity on the jobsite while improving building outcomes for contractors, designers, and owners alike. 
All InSoFast products are manufactured in the USA, and we ship to all lower 48 U.S. states and Canada, delivering directly to the project site to simplify logistics and scheduling. Our team prides themselves on supporting projects with excellent customer service, personalized recommendations and access to technical experts throughout the project. 
InSoFast Insulation Panels 
InSoFast insulation panels are the foundation of our system approach. Designed for interior, exterior, and shipping container applications, these panels combine continuous insulation with built-in attachment points for finishes, eliminating the need for traditional framing in many assemblies. 

Interior Panels help transform basements, retrofit spaces, and new construction by improving thermal performance while creating a ready-to-finish surface.
Exterior Panels deliver continuous insulation to reduce thermal bridging and supports durable, high-performance building envelopes.
Shipping Container Panels address one of the most challenging building types by controlling condensation, improving comfort, and streamlining interior projects.

Together, these panels help projects move faster while supporting energy-efficient, code-compliant construction. 
The X-Bracket System 
The X‑Bracket System is a structural framing innovation designed for both residential construction and shipping container projects. This advanced polymer bracket system replaces much of the traditional lumber framing required in walls, creating strong, straight, and thermally efficient assemblies. 
By reducing wood usage and eliminating thermal bridging, the X-Bracket System supports healthier indoor environments while enabling builders to frame faster with greater consistency. It integrates seamlessly with InSoFast insulation panels, creating a unified system that enhances performance without adding complexity. 
Introducing the Batt-Bracket (Coming 2026) 
Launching in January 2026, the Batt‑Bracket expands InSoFast solutions to support traditional batt insulation within a smarter framing framework. The Batt-Bracket provides flexibility for projects which require or prefer batt insulation—without sacrificing alignment, performance, or efficiency. 
Built for Builders. Designed for Performance. 
From manufacturing in the United States to delivering directly to job sites across the lower 48 states and Canada, InSoFast is committed to helping builders succeed. Our systems are trusted on projects ranging from homes and multifamily buildings to commercial spaces and innovative shipping container developments. 
Step into the future of insulation with InSoFast, we’d love to partner on your next project!
