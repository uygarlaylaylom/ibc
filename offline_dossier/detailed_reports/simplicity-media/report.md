## IBS Description
Simplicity Media helps residential builders and home service brands create predictable demand by aligning TV, streaming audio, and digital advertising with how their business actually operates. 
  
We focus on reducing wasted ad spend, improving customer quality, and giving leadership clear visibility into what drives calls, appointments, and signed contracts. Our strategies are built around inventory, geography, and sales capacity, not just impressions or clicks. 
  
Builders work with Simplicity Media when they want advertising that feels steady, measurable, and explainable rather than reactive and confusing, so every dollar works harder and drives real outcomes.
