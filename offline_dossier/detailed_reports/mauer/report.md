## IBS Description
Mauer is an innovative construction technology company delivering engineered brick façade systems purpose-built for modern, off-site and panelized construction in the United States. The company blends the enduring appeal of traditional masonry with advanced manufacturing to provide high-performance exterior wall solutions for timber frame, light-gauge steel, SIPs, and modular building systems. 
Mauer’s patented panel technology replicates the look and feel of conventional brick while offering dramatically faster installation, consistent factory-controlled quality, and reduced on-site labor. The Mauerwall system is designed to help builders and developers overcome critical challenges including skilled labor shortages, extended build schedules, and rising material costs — without compromising architectural character. 
Each Mauerwall façade is supplied as a precision-engineered kit, including pre-formed corners, openings, and integrated details. This approach streamlines installation, minimizes weather delays, and improves site safety, while supporting design flexibility through a wide selection of colors, finishes, and custom architectural features. 
Sustainability is central to Mauer's mission. The system delivers lower embodied carbon than traditional brick construction and supports energy-efficient building envelopes, helping projects meet evolving environmental standards and ESG goals across residential and commercial developments. 
By combining the heritage aesthetic of masonry with the efficiency of modern manufacturing, Mauer enables builders, architects, and building system manufacturers to achieve faster delivery, predictable quality, and scalable construction — redefining how brick façades are delivered for the next generation of buildings.
