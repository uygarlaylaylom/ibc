## IBS Description
Built for builders who want less stress and better margins. 
Buildxact is construction management software designed specifically for residential builders and remodelers who want to spend less time on paperwork and more time building — powered by Blu, an AI construction assistant built on 15 years of construction experience to improve accuracy, save time, and increase margins. 
We simplify estimating, quoting, job management, and purchasing — turning plans into accurate estimates and live jobs without double handling or guesswork. Everything stays connected, so your team, your numbers, and your suppliers are always in sync. 
Buildxact is the only Home Depot integration that lets you do everything in one place — with live pricing, in-app ordering, and receipting directly inside Buildxact. No switching systems. No manual updates. Just faster, more accurate purchasing. 
Whether you’re quoting faster, reducing errors, or getting clearer visibility across your jobs, Buildxact helps you run a more efficient, profitable building business.
