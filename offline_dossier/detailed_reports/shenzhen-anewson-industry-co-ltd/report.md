## IBS Description
Shenzhen Anewson Industry Co., Ltd. is a modern enterprise specializing in the research, development, production, and service of high-quality, whole-home customized home furnishing products. The company is committed to providing global customers with "one-stop home furnishing solutions, " from space design to final delivery, comprehensively meeting the home furnishing needs of various scenarios, including homes and commercial spaces. 
In terms of its product portfolio, the company has built a comprehensive product portfolio covering key home scenarios, including door and window systems, stair railings, integrated kitchen cabinets, custom wardrobes, bathroom cabinets, and solid wood doors. Door and window systems utilize high-strength profiles and energy-saving glass, providing both sound insulation and thermal insulation, as well as safety protection. Stair railings combine aesthetic design with structural stability, adapting to a variety of decor styles, from modern to classic. Customized products (cabinets, wardrobes, bathroom cabinets, and wooden doors) are centered around personalization, allowing for customized designs tailored to the customer's home size, aesthetic preferences, and functional requirements. Using environmentally friendly panels and high-quality hardware, the products ensure not only aesthetics and practicality, but also adhere to healthy living standards. 
To provide customers with a worry-free and efficient customization experience, the company has established a "full-process closed-loop service system" that covers every step, from request communication to after-sales support. First, professional designers conduct on-site precise measurements, integrating the space's characteristics with the customer's needs to identify key requirements. Detailed design drawings and 3D renderings are then produced, allowing customers to visually preview the final result and quickly adjust and optimize based on feedback. Once the design is confirmed, production begins at our large-scale, modern production facility. 
The company's Foshan facility, spanning over 30, 000 square meters, is equipped with several industry-leading automated production lines, including CNC cutting machines, fully automatic edge banding machines, and precision drilling centers. This ensures an efficient flow from raw material processing to finished product assembly, with an annual production capacity capable of meeting demand for over 50, 000 whole-home customization units. Throughout the production process, a comprehensive quality control system, encompassing raw material testing, process inspections, and finished product spot checks, is in place. A professional quality inspection team and sophisticated testing equipment ensure that every product meets quality standards. Finally, an experienced installation team provides on-site professional installation, post-installation commissioning and acceptance services, and a comprehensive after-sales service record is established to provide customers with long-term user protection and maintenance support. 
Leveraging superior product quality, large-scale production capabilities, and efficient service capabilities, the company's products have successfully expanded to multiple regions around the world, with an export network covering countries and regions such as North America, Europe, Canada, Australia, and the Caribbean. The company localizes product adaptation and service optimization based on the building standards, climate characteristics, and consumer preferences of different overseas markets.
