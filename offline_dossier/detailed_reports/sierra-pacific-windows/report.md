## IBS Description
Welcome to windows and doors that never compromise, made by people who don't either. From our extruded aluminum cladding that's twice as thick as roll-form cladding, to cutting edge glazing technology for greater thermal efficiency, our combination of impeccable construction and design innovation make every product one-of-a-kind. 
600 dealers, distributors and company stores throughout the country and five manufacturing plants strategically located in California,  Wisconsin and Alabama ensure our world-class windows and doors will be delivered to you where and when you need them. 
Sierra Pacific Windows is a division of Sierra Pacific Industries, which sustainably manages over 2 million acres of timberland in California, Oregon and Washington state. We are the largest private land owner and one of the largest lumber companies in the United States.  As a proud part of this family-owned, environmentally-committed company, Sierra Pacific is the only window company that manufactures its products with complete vertical integration.  This allows continuous quality control from the moment our tree seeds are planted until our beautiful wood windows and doors are produced, approved and delivered to you.
