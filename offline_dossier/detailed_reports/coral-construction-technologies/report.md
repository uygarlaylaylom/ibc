## IBS Description
Coral Construction Technologies represents a revolution in 3D concrete printing and automation in the construction industry. The company utilizes its proprietary 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) technology, enabling efficient and uncompromising execution of even the most demanding projects - from family homes to complex multi-storey buildings and urban infrastructure. 
3D concrete printing brings freedom of form, high precision, and significant savings in material, time, and labor. At the same time, it contributes to sustainability by minimizing waste and energy consumption. 
Coral is the result of a collaboration between two strong groups - MTX Group, which brings expertise in 3D printing and automation through its subsidiary ICE Industrial Services, and PURPOSIA Group, whose construction division HSF System provides engineering and execution capabilities. 
Coral Construction Technologies integrates advanced technology, research, and timeless design. The result is effective, aesthetically refined, and technically advanced buildings that push the boundaries of architecture and set a new standard for 21st-century construction.
