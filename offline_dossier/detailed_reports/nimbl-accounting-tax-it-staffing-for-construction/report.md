## IBS Description
Nimbl provides construction-specific accounting and financial advisory services for residential builders and construction companies navigating growth, margin pressure, and operational complexity. We specialize in job costing, cash flow clarity, and scale-ready financial systems that help builders understand exactly where they’re making money—and where they’re losing it. 
Our team works alongside established construction firms to clean up and optimize their financial operations, from job-level reporting and revenue recognition to subcontractor compliance and lender-ready financials. We’re built for the tools builders already use, including Buildertrend, and focus on practical, real-world insights rather than accounting jargon. 
At IBS, we’re focused on starting honest conversations with builders about profitability, systems, and scaling without chaos. If you’re growing past the “figure it out as you go” stage and want clearer financial visibility to support smarter decisions, Nimbl is here to help.
