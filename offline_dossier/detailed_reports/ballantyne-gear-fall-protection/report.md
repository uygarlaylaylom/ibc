## IBS Description
Ballantyne Gear designs and manufactures the Eveook™ Fall Protection System — a fully engineered, non-penetrating fall protection solution designed specifically for sloped roofs. Constructed from lightweight, aerospace-grade aluminum and certified as an ANSI Z359.6 engineered system, the Eveook™ protects up to eight users in both fall restraint and fall arrest, far exceeding OSHA and CSA Z259.16 requirements and hold 19+ patents and patents pending. 
Unlike traditional anchors that rely on unprotected installers to set up and nails and screws, with roof penetration, the Eveook™ installs without stepping on the roof giving real installer protection and without damaging the roof surface or soffits. With multiple installation methods, including single-person setup options, crews can work safely and efficiently — even on steep or complex roof structures. 
Engineered and tested to a breaking strength of more than 9,000 pounds each, the Eveook™ Fall Protection System delivers uncompromising safety, mobility, and compliance. Ballantyne Gear also offers a full line of purpose-built accessories designed to expand the system’s versatility and adapt to a wide range of roof styles and job conditions. 
Ballantyne Gear’s mission is simple: protect your people — and your profits. By redefining how fall protection is approached on sloped roofs, we’re helping businesses prevent injuries, avoid citations, and strengthen their safety culture. Visit our booth to see how advanced engineering, practical design, and proven innovation are transforming roof safety standards.
