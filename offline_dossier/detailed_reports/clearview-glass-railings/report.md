## IBS Description
ClearView Glass Railings is a glass railing supplier located in Minnesota. Unlike hardwoods, glass railings don’t need repeated painting or finishing for enhancing their durability. This is a vital consideration since decks/patios are continuously exposed to external, weather conditions. CVGRailings Hercules Glass panels use tempered laminated panels with patent pending Lever Spigots made of Duplex 2205 Stainless Steel. 
Neither glass nor the patent pending Lever Spigots made of Duplex 2205 Stainless Steel corrode when exposed to water. The outer surface of glass panels is better suited to tolerate temperature extremes. As a result, unlike hardwood railings, glass railings are not vulnerable to surface cracking. 
CVGRailings Hercules Glass panels are test proven to hold an amazing 2,520# vertical load and a 820# horizontal load. They are 13.5mm thick tempered laminated glass made with two layers of 6mm tempered glass that is laminated together with a 1.5mm layer of a PVB plastic glass panel. 
This makes glass railings as sturdy and safe as wood or purely metal based railings. The use of transparent glass ensures that visibility through the deck is maintained. Blocking of the external view is a major issue with metal/wood railings.
