## IBS Description
The SubAssist Suite is an end-to-end software ecosystem designed to protect subcontractor profit margins by automating the entire lifecycle of a job—from the first purchase order to the final invoice. It integrates three powerful modules to eliminate manual entry and pricing errors: 

SubAssist Core: Automatically reconciles builder purchase orders against contracts to guarantee pricing accuracy and instantly converts them into AR sales orders and actionable material orders.
SubAssist Connect: Acts as the central integration hub, seamlessly syncing data between builder portals, field management tools, and accounting systems (QuickBooks, Sage) to automate scheduling, dispatch, and financial reporting.
InvoiceIQ: Uses AI-powered auditing to capture and process complex invoices, cross-referencing line items against agreed pricing to detect overcharges and deliver actionable business intelligence for credit.

Together, these tools create a closed-loop system that ensures data flows seamlessly from builders to financial ledgers, preventing revenue leakage and streamlining administrative workflows.
