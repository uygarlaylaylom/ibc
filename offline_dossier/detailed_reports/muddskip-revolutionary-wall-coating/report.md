## IBS Description
Muddskip is a purpose driven "Made in USA" company solving the bottleneck in construction with it's revolutionary patented technology that reduces the time it takes to finish drywalls by 50% or more.  Our technology tranforms ANY existing joint compound into an easy to use compound that enables REHYDRATION that supports wet on wet layering of compound for multiple coats in a day.  We take away the time in which you wait for traditional joint compound to dry, eliminating sanding steps and saving 50% or more time in the process.  Not only that, but you can completely eliminate Sanding if you need a dust free working environment.  It's ok to sand but not required as the compound compresses and flushes out very tight unlike traditional joint compound and with the rehydrating  capability you can eliminate sanding all together when necessary. 
Achieve a Level 5 Smooth or beyond finish in a fraction of the time with Ease of Use for anyone from a novice to a pro.  Use from taping and bedding to desired finish.  2 options: Heavy Duty from seams to Level 4, Textures and Heavy Repairs.  Smooth from seams to Level 5 Smooth and if you want the strongest seams and hardest finish like plaster add 8 oz of Muddskip Finisher for Best in Class Muddskip System!  Muddskip FInisher and Conditioner can be used to seal substrates that are difficult to adhere to, also seals torn paper on drywall and when used as a hydrating polisher will give you a plaster level smooth.

This technology was created by contractors, for contractors, in an effort to make others’ lives better. Fueled by tremendous loss, herein the why behind Muddskip. Randy Cross was a contractor his entire life, starting as a plastering apprentice in the 1970s and continuing to mentor and share his skills with others, just as he was mentored as a teen by a master plasterer who paid it forward. Randy went on to develop a career that evolved into master carpentry, designing and building homes, and investing in real estate. He was always helping people, stepping into “big brother” shoes for many he cared about along the way. Born and raised in the Midwest, it was not uncommon to see struggles with alcoholism, and it’s no secret the trades in general have a higher rate of people struggling with addiction, chronic diseases, and mental health issues. Randy was an amazing human with a heart for good—every day looking for a way to make someone’s day better. I learned this from him, and it has become the foundation of Muddskip today.

We can use our energy for love or fear; be a catalyst for happiness or sadness, good or bad. Choose your story wisely, because what we do with our minutes each day on this earth matters.
