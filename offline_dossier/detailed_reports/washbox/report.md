## IBS Description
Washbox
Washbox is a global leader in professional washout and liquid waste management systems for the construction and custom home building sector. Founded by tradespeople and engineers, Washbox was created to solve one of the industry’s most persistent and overlooked challenges: uncontrolled tool washout that damages sites, risks compliance, and undermines professional standards. 
Designed specifically for modern residential and light commercial construction, Washbox products allow painters, builders, and contractors to clean tools efficiently on site while capturing and containing wash water, waste solids, and microplastic emissions. By keeping liquid waste on site and out of drainage systems, Washbox helps projects maintain clean working environments, protect surrounding communities, and uphold premium build standards. 
At NHBS, Washbox is showcasing its integrated range of practical, job ready solutions, including the Washbox Rocket mobile wash station, the ultra-portable Washbox Rover for vehicle based and residential work, and the RollerWash collar for fast, contained roller cleaning. Together, these products form a complete washout management system designed to fit seamlessly into everyday construction workflows. 
The Washbox Rocket is a battery powered, self-contained multi trade wash station that provides its own water supply and closed loop filtration system. It enables multiple trades to wash tools on site without plumbing connections, discharge points, or permanent infrastructure. Its compact, freestanding design makes it ideal for custom home builds, fit outs, and active renovation projects. 
The Washbox Rover extends this capability into ultra-portable applications, allowing professional washout to take place directly from a vehicle, driveway, or confined residential site. Built for contractors on the move, Rover delivers full containment and waste capture in a compact format suited to single family homes and small-scale projects. 
Complementing these systems, and also available as a standalone device to be used with nay garden hose, the Rollerwash collar provides painters with a simple, controlled method for washing and reusing rollers. By containing wash water and preventing splashing or runoff, it helps improve site cleanliness, extend tool life, and reduce unnecessary waste. 
All Washbox systems are designed around three core principles: efficiency, professionalism, and environmental responsibility. Every product is engineered to save time, reduce mess, and simplify compliance, while supporting higher standards of workmanship and site management. 
Washbox is also the world’s first app connected wash station platform, giving users access to a secure cloud dashboard where they can view water use, waste captured, and pollution prevented across individual projects or portfolios. This data driven approach supports transparent reporting, quality assurance, and continuous improvement for builders and contractors. 
With deployments across Australia, the United Kingdom, North America, and Europe, Washbox solutions are already trusted on hundreds of projects worldwide. The company works closely with builders, manufacturers, and supply partners to ensure its products meet real world jobsite needs and are ready for professional distribution at scale. 
For custom home builders, tradespeople, and distributors, Washbox represents the new standard in washout management: practical, proven systems that protect reputation, improve efficiency, and support better building practices.
