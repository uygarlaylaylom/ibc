## IBS Description
Algoma is an AI-powered real estate development platform that helps builders evaluate sites and make early-stage investment decisions faster and with greater clarity. The platform automates key pre-construction workflows, including zoning analysis, site capacity, feasibility modeling, massing, rent comps, and early design generation, turning what traditionally takes weeks of fragmented consultant work into a streamlined, data-driven process completed in minutes. 
Built for small and mid-sized developers as well as larger teams, Algoma centralizes critical parcel, market, and regulatory data into a single workflow and pairs it with AI-assisted analysis and visualization tools. Developers can move from address to feasibility, compare scenarios, generate layouts, and produce investor-ready outputs without stitching together multiple tools and vendors. 
By reducing time, cost, and uncertainty at the front end of development, Algoma enables teams to evaluate more opportunities, make better go/no-go decisions, and advance projects with greater confidence. The company works with developers, builders, and investors across multiple markets and is backed by leading PropTech investors.
