## IBS Description
Mbrico is a U.S.-made and patented porcelain tile decking system engineered for decks, balconies, flatroofs, etc in residential and commercial applications. Unlike surface-only materials, Mbrico is a complete, elevated system built around patented pedestal rooftop and joist framed innovations designed to deliver long-term performance with minimal maintenance. 
Mbrico decks are non-combustible, non-porous, ADA-compliant for slip resistance, and approved for freeze-thaw environments. The system supports high load and high wind ratings while resisting moisture, mold, mildew, and UV degradation. Because porcelain does not rot, warp, or fade, Mbrico provides a durable alternative for rooftops, balconies, pool decks, and ground-level outdoor living spaces. 
Designed for architects, builders, and developers seeking longevity without sacrificing aesthetics, Mbrico offers a wide range of finishes including wood, stone, slate, travertine, and modern looks. Every system is engineered for precision, safety, and repeatable installation, making it suitable for both luxury residential and large-scale commercial projects. 
At IBS, Mbrico is showcasing its largest booth to date, featuring new system innovations, updated collateral, and patented advancements that continue to redefine what elevated outdoor surfaces can be.
