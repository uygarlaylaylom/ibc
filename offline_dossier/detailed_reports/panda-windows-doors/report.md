## IBS Description
Panda Windows & Doors was established in 1991 in Las Vegas, Nevada with a goal to create beautiful pieces of functional glass that perform as well as they look. The company designed, manufactured, and delivered its first aluminum framed folding door to a remodeled custom home located in Downtown Las Vegas.
