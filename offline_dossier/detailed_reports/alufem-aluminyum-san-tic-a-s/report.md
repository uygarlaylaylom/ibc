## IBS Description
Alufem Aluminium operates in the Kayseri Organized Industrial Zone, providing customer-oriented, fast, and innovative services within a 50,000 m² enclosed production facility. The plant houses aluminium extrusion press lines, polishing surface treatment machines, anodizing facilities, electrostatic powder coating units, wood-effect lamination systems, CNC mechanical processing centers, assembly lines, and expert teams. 
Our company has an annual production capacity of over 27,000 tons of aluminium profiles with extrusion press lines of 1,100 USTons (5”), 2,000 USTons (7”), and 4,000 MTons (10”). We manufacture profiles in various alloys through T0, T4, T5, and T6 heat treatment processes. 
In our anodizing facility, matte, bright, and satin finishes can be applied up to 7.5 meters in length with an annual capacity of 4,000,000 m². Coloring demands ranging from light bronze to black are met using Tin Sulphate and Nickel Sulphate baths. 
The aluminium wood-effect lamination machine enhances production flexibility by allowing rapid and efficient color changes. It is designed to provide durable and reliable wood-effect coating on aluminium profile surfaces. A wood-like appearance is applied to aluminium profiles through high-quality production and assembly processes. 
Our vertical and horizontal electrostatic powder coating facilities offer a service capacity of 28,000 tons/year, covering all RAL codes and architectural coating standards. The powder coating units are designed to be completely isolated from external environmental factors, and production is carried out with fully automatic, process-controlled cabin systems. 
Within our facility, 3- and 4-axis CNC profile machining centers, CNC double-head angular saws, precision cutting machines, and custom process machinery lines enable meticulous and rapid execution of mechanical operations as required by our customers. 
In our R&D center, we provide design and technical support in line with customer demands, working with a focus on maximum quality and satisfaction.
