## IBS Description
20four7VA helps builders and construction companies scale efficiently by providing highly vetted virtual assistants who handle the back-office work that keeps projects moving.  
For more than 10 years, we’ve supported builders and construction teams with administrative operations, project coordination, estimating support, scheduling, invoicing, and customer communications, freeing owners and project managers to stay focused on the job site.  
Every Construction Virtual Assistant is carefully screened and trained to support the fast-paced demands of construction operations. Our VAs integrate seamlessly into your existing workflows, supporting your team with consistent, process-driven execution. Whether you need support for one project or across multiple teams, our Construction VAs give you the flexibility to scale without adding internal headcount—while maintaining control, accountability, and continuity.  
We handle recruitment, vetting, onboarding, HR compliance, and payroll, delivering reliable, long-term virtual support without the complexity of hiring internally.
