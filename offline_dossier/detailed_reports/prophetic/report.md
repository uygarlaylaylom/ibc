## IBS Description
The AI-Native Land Acquisition Engine 
Prophetic removes evaluation capacity as your growth constraint. Built AI-native from the ground up, our platform enables land teams to analyze opportunities 42x faster and make confident decisions in minutes, not weeks. 
Trusted by 72% of Builder 100 companies including D.R. Horton, Shea Homes, and Century Communities. Prophetic is the single source of truth for land intelligence. Our platform unifies what previously required five or more tools: zoning analysis, environmental due diligence, ownership data, automated site planning, and off-market outreach. All in one SOC 2-certified system. 
Real outcomes from customers: 

Analyze 42x more opportunities without adding headcount
Reduce parcel research time from days to minutes
Find off-market deals hiding in markets they've worked for decades
Avoid million-dollar site constraints before making offers
Achieve 10-18x higher outreach response rates than traditional methods

Visit booth [S7059] to see why land teams say: "I can't imagine doing this job without it, and I've done this job without it for more than a decade." 
You can't win deals you can't see. Stop by for a live demo and discover what you're missing.
