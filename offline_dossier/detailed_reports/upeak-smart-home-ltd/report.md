## IBS Description
UPeak Elevator Ltd.: Engineering the Future of Home Mobility 
For over three decades, the founding team behind UPeak Smart Home Ltd. has been at the forefront of the commercial elevator industry, managing complex projects for metro systems, high-rise towers, hospitals, and government buildings. This legacy of engineering excellence—rooted in uncompromising safety, reliability, and performance—is now the foundation of our residential innovation. 
Introducing EasyRise—the first home elevator powered by direct electric drive, engineered to bring commercial-grade quality into the heart of your home. 

EasyRise Home Elevator: The New Standard for Residential Mobility 
Traditional home elevators often come with compromises: noise, space demands, high maintenance, oil leak, and complex installation. EasyRise was designed to eliminate every one of these limitations. By integrating the best of screw, hydraulic, and traction technologies, we’ve created a home elevator that delivers superior performance without sacrifice. 

Key Features for Modern Homebuilders & Buyers

Eco-Friendly & EfficientOur oil-free direct-drive motor eliminates contamination risks and reduces energy consumption, supporting sustainable home design. 


Space-Saving & Flexible InstallationNo pit required and minimal structural demands make EasyRise ideal for both new builds and retrofits. 


AI-Powered Smart MaintenanceProactive remote monitoring, fault prediction, and smart scheduling enhance safety, reduce downtime, and streamline service. 


Cost-Effective Design & InstallationSimplified engineering and faster installation lower total cost of ownership while maintaining top-tier safety and quality. 


Low-Maintenance & Homeowner-FriendlyBuilt with a “simplify the complex” approach for easier, faster, and more affordable long-term upkeep. 



At UPeak Smart Home Ltd., we merge the rigorous engineering standards of commercial elevators with the elegance and simplicity modern homeowners deserve.
