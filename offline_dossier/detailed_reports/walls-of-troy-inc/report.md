## IBS Description
Imagine a panelized housing system that doesn't require drywall. In fact, it eliminates six of the "trades" required for stick-built homes. 
A first in North America, The Walls of Troy are non-combustible, anti-microbial, super resilient panels that have been used for home construction in Europe for decades. Made of solid wood-wool and Portland cement, they are perfect for our local seismic and weather-related disaster areas. In fact, our showcase home is currently being built in Oklahoma-- the heart of tornado alley. 
Stop by our booth (W4671) and see our panels and the unique "Structulink" rebar system we use to tie them all together into safe, more affordable homes.
