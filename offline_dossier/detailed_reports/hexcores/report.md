## IBS Description
The lightweight door with solid performance.
Our doors solve problems others ignore. Heavy doors strain installers and hardware. Ours don’t. We engineered away the weight but kept the substance. The result feels solid, exhibits meticulous craftsmanship, and installs with ease. One person can handle what once required three. That’s meaningful innovation. 
We craft custom, lightweight doors that combine exceptional aesthetics with practical innovation, making installation easier, reducing material waste, and delivering superior performance for high-end residential and commercial spaces.
