## IBS Description
Roof It and Reap the Rewards! Palram Americas is the leader in polycarbonate roof covering solutions for decks, patios and pergolas - with options to meet any budget or project requirement. 
Many deck projects are missing the key upgrade that transforms the space and adds to your bottom line – a roof! Palram’s roofing solutions bridge the gap between high-end custom roofs and basic coverings. Panels are virtually unbreakable, providing 100% UV resistance and high snow & wind load capacity. 
New EZ GLAZE® premium polycarbonate panels offer a sleek, glass-like appearance with a unique design for fast installation compared to a wood/shingle roof. The corrugated edges easily overlap & fasten to rafters for a quick AND easy install. 
The SUNSCAPE® architectural system is a 3-part residential roof covering solution that includes premium-grade polycarbonate panels and durable, anodized profiles. It offers a sophisticated, modern option for covering decks and patios. 
Our corrugated roof panels, including SUNTUF® - the #1 corrugated polycarbonate panel in the market - round out our offering.  
And with our Panel Pros Contractor Rewards Program, you can earn rewards just for using our roof panels! 
Learn about EZ Glaze, Sunscape & Suntuf panels & how we can help boost profits on every job, while delivering year-round flexibility for homeowners to enjoy their outdoor spaces.
