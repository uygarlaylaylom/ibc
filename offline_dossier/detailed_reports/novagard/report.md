## IBS Description
Novagard, a Certified Women’s Business Enterprise headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is an innovator and manufacturer of high-performance silicone and hybrid sealants for the building industry that are used in a variety of applications such as window manufacturing, window & door installation, backbedding, glazing, and gutter, siding & wall panel installation. 
Our premier sealant, NovaFlex Pro Premium Adhesive Sealant, is a neutral cure silicone formulation that allows for permanent flexibility and excellent adhesion to the most common building materials. It is great for installing windows, doors, siding, metal roofs & panels, and sealing nooks and crannies inside and out. It is an odorless, all-weather silicone that completely cures in a couple of days, and remains flexible to resist cracking, mildew, and discoloration for years to come. 
NovaBond Pro Hybrid Sealant is an all-weather, universal sealant that offers superior adhesion with near-zero shrinkage. NovaBond can shorten your typical job time because it requires no mixing or preparation, is easy to gun and tool, bonds to a variety of substrates without priming, and is paintable in just 30 minutes. 
Qwik-Set Low Migration Glazing Sealant is part of our award-winning Qwik-Set family of products. This glazing sealant is an innovative, two-component, neutral cure silicone that rapidly builds adhesive and develops a primerless bond for bedding and glazing of glass in residential and commercial window designs. Engineered with the added benefit of low migration to protect and prevent breakdown of the secondary sealant, it creates a strong bond to provide a long-lasting seal that prevents premature failures and callbacks. This sealant cures in minutes, not hours or days, and is available in a variable mix ratio or a new 10:1 fixed portable format. 
Stop by booth W7873 to meet our team! All of Novagard’s professional-grade silicones are easy to use, environmentally friendly, and VOC compliant.
