## IBS Description
Schnell Home, a brand of the Schnell Group, sells machines for the production of the characteristic panels of the Concrewall construction system. The system is unique and simple: the basic element is a panel made up of a polystyrene core and two electro welded meshes joined together. The same factory can produce all the structural elements that make up the Concrewall system: 
· Double panel, used for load bearing walls;· Single panel, used for load bearing walls, partitions, and exterior walls;· Roof panels for flat or inclined roofs, as well as slabs for mezzanine floors and ceilings;· Staircases. 
Concrewall, used for the construction of private houses or industrialized buildings, proves to be an advantageous system in terms of quality of life, as it is earthquake resistant and provides thermal and acoustic insulation. 
The system is certified by Evaluation Report ESR-3429.
