The platform automates key pre-construction workflows, including zoning analysis, site capacity, feasibility modeling, massing, rent comps, and early design generation, turning what traditionally takes weeks of fragmented consultant work into a streamlined, data-driven process completed in minutes. 
Built for small and mid-sized developers as well as larger teams, Algoma centralizes critical parcel, market, and regulatory data into a single workflow and pairs it with AI-assisted analysis and visualization tools. Developers can move from address to feasibility, compare scenarios, generate layouts, and produce investor-ready outputs without stitching together multiple tools and vendors. 
By reducing time, cost, and uncertainty at the front end of development, Algoma enables teams to evaluate more opportunities, make better go/no-go decisions, and advance projects with greater confidence.

Unlike hardwoods, glass railings don’t need repeated painting or finishing for enhancing their durability. This is a vital consideration since decks/patios are continuously exposed to external, weather conditions. CVGRailings Hercules Glass panels use tempered laminated panels with patent pending Lever Spigots made of Duplex 2205 Stainless Steel. 
Neither glass nor the patent pending Lever Spigots made of Duplex 2205 Stainless Steel corrode when exposed to water. The outer surface of glass panels is better suited to tolerate temperature extremes. As a result, unlike hardwood railings, glass railings are not vulnerable to surface cracking. 
CVGRailings Hercules Glass panels are test proven to hold an amazing 2,520# vertical load and a 820# horizontal load. They are 13.5mm thick tempered laminated glass made with two layers of 6mm tempered glass that is laminated together with a 1.5mm layer of a PVB plastic glass panel. 
This makes glass railings as sturdy and safe as wood or purely metal based railings. The use of transparent glass ensures that visibility through the deck is maintained.

Greenstone Slate’s quarries have produced exceptionally fine quality stone for roofing slate for over a century. Greenstone has shipped slate all over the world for residential and institutional projects. Our quarries are located in the heart of what is known as the Slate Valley— a region primarily in Vermont, extending slightly into New York State. It is a region that has a history of producing some of the finest quality slate in the world. All Greenstone architectural roofing slate meets ASTM C406, and is rated S1, the highest available strength and longevity rating. Our stone is worked by Greenstone-trained craftsmen and our production facilities are continually updated and expanded to enhance our standards of excellence in manufacturing. This has led the Greenstone Slate Company to become a principal worldwide producer of colored slate roofing. 
A Greenstone Slate® roof can be expected to have a useful life range of 75 to more than 300 years. Beyond the prestigious ASTM S1, 75-year life expectancy rating, our slate is backed by Greenstone’s 100-year warranty. We consistently deliver high-quality product, excellence in service and installation support, and competitive direct pricing—for the highest value possible in a slate roof. 
This year at The International Builders’ Show, we’ll be highlighting the benefits of the Greenstone Slate’s HAILFIRE™ ultimate roof! We’ll also be demonstrating the breakthrough slate lightweight installation method—SlateTec™—that reduces the weight of a genuine slate roof installation without compromise in protection or appearance. Genuine slate roofs can now be installed on nearly any new or re-roof project, even historical roof restorations that may have structural obstacles due to age, when a slate roof aesthetic and protection are desirable to maintain. A roof cross-section will be on display showing how SlateTec installation technology can reduce roof weight to under 6 pounds per square foot, can lower structural costs, and streamline the installation of the slate itself. 
We invite architects, contractors, project managers, and building envelope specialists to visit our booth or contact us to discuss the long-term protection and environmental benefits of Greenstone® Vermont slate for any roofing or cladding project.",Product,Poultney,Vermont,USA,Building Materials,s_building-materials,l_poultney-vermont-usa

WiFi-Enabled Power Pet Doors (e.g., Power Pet WiFi Door): These retain all the core features of the Power Pet series while adding remote control through a smartphone app. Users can open/close the door, configure up to 20 weekly access timers, adjust sensor ranges, and view a log of door activity. 


Motorized Power Pet Roll-Up Doors: These doors — available in medium, large, and extra-large sizes — feature a motorized roll-up panel (rather than a rigid flap) that retracts upward.

Armor Flex Manual Doors (e.g., Armor Flex Pet Door): These are engineered to be extremely durable and weather-tight. Their flap is made from interlocking ABS segments, each sealed by rare-earth magnets to ensure a rigid, airtight closure along the sides yet flexible enough for your pet to pass through. The frame is heavy-gauge aluminum with stainless steel hardware. 


DuraFlex (DuraFlex) Pet Door: Designed for lifetime durability, these doors feature a strong yet flexible vinyl flap surrounded by a wide flange with embedded rare-earth magnets. The frame is made of high-strength aluminum, sealed with floating magnetic seals for a 100% airtight, draft-free fit—even in winds up to 50 mph

For over 20 years, we have been an innovator in the insulation industry, with engineered solutions that save time and money. We pride ourselves on excellent customer service and quality products 100% made in the USA. InSoFast strives to change the way homes are built, making them more comfortable, energy efficient and healthier. We are passionate about “The Perfect Wall” and bringing this vision for high performance homes to the building science industry with our insulation solutions. 
Who We Are 
At our core, InSoFast is focused on performance-driven innovation. We design insulation systems to solve real-world challenges including thermal bridging, condensation, mold risk, and labor inefficiency. Every product is engineered to work as part of a complete system—reducing complexity on the jobsite while improving building outcomes for contractors, designers, and owners alike. 
All InSoFast products are manufactured in the USA, and we ship to all lower 48 U.S. states and Canada, delivering directly to the project site to simplify logistics and scheduling. Our team prides themselves on supporting projects with excellent customer service, personalized recommendations and access to technical experts throughout the project. 
InSoFast Insulation Panels 
InSoFast insulation panels are the foundation of our system approach. Designed for interior, exterior, and shipping container applications, these panels combine continuous insulation with built-in attachment points for finishes, eliminating the need for traditional framing in many assemblies. 

Interior Panels help transform basements, retrofit spaces, and new construction by improving thermal performance while creating a ready-to-finish surface.
Exterior Panels deliver continuous insulation to reduce thermal bridging and supports durable, high-performance building envelopes.
Shipping Container Panels address one of the most challenging building types by controlling condensation, improving comfort, and streamlining interior projects.

Together, these panels help projects move faster while supporting energy-efficient, code-compliant construction. 
The X-Bracket System 
The X‑Bracket System is a structural framing innovation designed for both residential construction and shipping container projects. This advanced polymer bracket system replaces much of the traditional lumber framing required in walls, creating strong, straight, and thermally efficient assemblies. 
By reducing wood usage and eliminating thermal bridging, the X-Bracket System supports healthier indoor environments while enabling builders to frame faster with greater consistency. It integrates seamlessly with InSoFast insulation panels, creating a unified system that enhances performance without adding complexity. 
Introducing the Batt-Bracket (Coming 2026) 
Launching in January 2026, the Batt‑Bracket expands InSoFast solutions to support traditional batt insulation within a smarter framing framework. The Batt-Bracket provides flexibility for projects which require or prefer batt insulation—without sacrificing alignment, performance, or efficiency. 
Built for Builders. Designed for Performance. 
From manufacturing in the United States to delivering directly to job sites across the lower 48 states and Canada, InSoFast is committed to helping builders succeed. Our systems are trusted on projects ranging from homes and multifamily buildings to commercial spaces and innovative shipping container developments.

We provide design-build teams with lighting design expertise as early as schematic design, with no new tools and processes required. Our packages combine luminaires from world-class manufacturers with advanced controls that are intelligent enough to disappear. The result is rich ambiance befitting a luxury hotel or retreat, but with continuous adaptation to household preferences and patterns, without onsite programming or specialized commissioning.Enrich your builds with highly responsive ambiance that brings your clients' dreams to life, with less work than conventional lighting schemes.

Automatically calculating perimeter, area, elevation, gradient and volume, Moasure collects essential measurement data without the need for GPS, Wi-Fi or mobile phone signal. 
The Bluetooth-connected app transforms measurements into dynamic 2D and 3D visuals in real-time on your smartphone screen – view, edit and save measurements, export as PDF/CSV or directly to CAD software. 
With over 100,000 Moasure 2 series devices sold to outdoor professionals, Moasure are now applying their award-winning technology to an indoor measuring device, designed to create instant floor plans with ease. 
Moasure LX1, launching later this year, will enable the user to simply walk through a property and capture accurate measurements within minutes, whilst watching the floor plan come to life on their tablet or smartphone in real time. The device captures area, perimeter, windows, doors, ceiling heights and wall thickness, and can handle irregular rooms with complex angles, including curved walls. 
A fully dimensioned floor plan is available in the Moasure app the moment the user finishes measuring, and can be exported directly to CAD software or shared as a PDF. 
LX1 offers a faster and smarter way to create accurate floor plans, fitting seamlessly into existing workflows.

We answer the questions that keep you up at 3am: How much should I pay for this lot? How fast will these homes sell? What are my competitors doing? What square footage actually moves in this market? 
What Atlas delivers: Demographics and buyer pool analysis. Competitive pricing intelligence. Absorption forecasts that tell you how long your specs will sit. School district data (because buyers always ask). CMA generation for bank loans. Off-market transaction data you can't get from MLS. 
What you avoid: $15K feasibility studies that take months. The 25 browser tabs of DIY research. Mispricing a home and watching it sit. Overpaying for land because you didn't know what sold down the street. 
We built Atlas because builders shouldn't need a six-figure research budget to make confident development decisions. Tell us a ZIP code. We'll show you what we see.

Ventique Metal Vents are here to offer a solution for flooring installers and homeowners alike-vents that are as unique as your floors. Over the years, we found that ordinary raised drop-in floor vents do not add anything to a home’s look, feel or value.  So, we set out to create a custom product that is functional and stylish, but also easy to install for skilled craftsman and DIY homeowners.  Ventique metal vents are compatible with nearly any type of flooring, and their flush mount for a seamless finish.  Our unique design with its flush mount frame and grill inserts set them apart from other vents. Our frame design is a ½” thick allowing for most tile flooring to be set flush with the frame. Composed of powder coated aluminum our vents will not rust chip, bend, crack, or peel.  And in durability tests our metal vents have proven their weight by upholding more than 875 pounds.   
We know that you may never have thought about your floor vents before as being something that you could pick a different style.  Now you can.  Why wait, upgrade yourself from the standard old boring vents you settled for to something new, beautiful, and smooth on the surface, Ventiques vents. 
All our vents are flush mount making them handicap accessible. For those in wheelchairs, scooters, or even using walkers, even the smallest bump of a raised floor vent can be a huge obstacle-and a safety risk. 
Our newest product our Kanyon Vents.   Are fully adjustable.  Meaning you can adjust the height of the register to the thickness of your flooring.  Making it flush mount for any type of flooring.   Go from 1/8"" on up.  Simply add spacers to adjust the height of the vent.  It is compatible with, LVP, Tile, Carpet, Laminate, Hardwood.",Product,Waite Park,Minnesota,USA,Interior Finishings & Home Living,s_interior-finishings-and-home-living,l_waite-park-minnesota-usa

Washbox is a global leader in professional washout and liquid waste management systems for the construction and custom home building sector. Founded by tradespeople and engineers, Washbox was created to solve one of the industry’s most persistent and overlooked challenges: uncontrolled tool washout that damages sites, risks compliance, and undermines professional standards. 
Designed specifically for modern residential and light commercial construction, Washbox products allow painters, builders, and contractors to clean tools efficiently on site while capturing and containing wash water, waste solids, and microplastic emissions. By keeping liquid waste on site and out of drainage systems, Washbox helps projects maintain clean working environments, protect surrounding communities, and uphold premium build standards. 
At NHBS, Washbox is showcasing its integrated range of practical, job ready solutions, including the Washbox Rocket mobile wash station, the ultra-portable Washbox Rover for vehicle based and residential work, and the RollerWash collar for fast, contained roller cleaning. Together, these products form a complete washout management system designed to fit seamlessly into everyday construction workflows. 
The Washbox Rocket is a battery powered, self-contained multi trade wash station that provides its own water supply and closed loop filtration system. It enables multiple trades to wash tools on site without plumbing connections, discharge points, or permanent infrastructure. Its compact, freestanding design makes it ideal for custom home builds, fit outs, and active renovation projects. 
The Washbox Rover extends this capability into ultra-portable applications, allowing professional washout to take place directly from a vehicle, driveway, or confined residential site. Built for contractors on the move, Rover delivers full containment and waste capture in a compact format suited to single family homes and small-scale projects. 
Complementing these systems, and also available as a standalone device to be used with nay garden hose, the Rollerwash collar provides painters with a simple, controlled method for washing and reusing rollers. By containing wash water and preventing splashing or runoff, it helps improve site cleanliness, extend tool life, and reduce unnecessary waste. 
All Washbox systems are designed around three core principles: efficiency, professionalism, and environmental responsibility. Every product is engineered to save time, reduce mess, and simplify compliance, while supporting higher standards of workmanship and site management. 
Washbox is also the world’s first app connected wash station platform, giving users access to a secure cloud dashboard where they can view water use, waste captured, and pollution prevented across individual projects or portfolios. This data driven approach supports transparent reporting, quality assurance, and continuous improvement for builders and contractors. 
With deployments across Australia, the United Kingdom, North America, and Europe, Washbox solutions are already trusted on hundreds of projects worldwide. The company works closely with builders, manufacturers, and supply partners to ensure its products meet real world jobsite needs and are ready for professional distribution at scale. 
For custom home builders, tradespeople, and distributors, Washbox represents the new standard in washout management: practical, proven systems that protect reputation, improve efficiency, and support better building practices.",Product,"Galston, New South Wales",,Australia,"Construction Tools, Systems, Equipment, & Safety",s_construction-tools-systems-equipment-and-safety,l_galston-new-south-wales-australia
